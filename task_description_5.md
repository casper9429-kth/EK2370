Tasks Review Meeting 4: COTS Radar
Sub-group 1 and 2 together:
1. Acquision of SAR image of 2 landscapes, overlay the images over google earth image.

2. Show results with and without using the Hann window. (for your own SAR data matrix)

3. Show results with and without multiplication of the down range data with the square of
the down range vector. (this is on the last slide of the algorithm) (use your own SAR data
matrix)

Sub-group 1: (all plots for your own acquired SAR data matrix)

a. Plot the entire data and the sync signal (zoom in to illustrate) (Lec.4, slide 32).

b. Show that the data is parsed correctly by plotting the parsed (according to the position of
the radar on rail) backscatter data together with the parsed sync data. (Lec.4, slide 33).

c. Plot the integrated data to show that the data is parsed correctly according to the up-
chirp. (Lec. 4, as shown in lower right figure on slide 34).

Sub-group 2: (all plots for your own acquired SAR data matrix)

a. Show variation in the final image with change in cr1 and cr2 (cross range limits).

b. Show variation in the final image with change in dr1 and dr2 (down range limits).

c. Show the effect of variation in scan time Trp (amount of time spent in one position on the
rail) on the resolution or SNR of the final image . Increase and decrease Trp to illustrate
